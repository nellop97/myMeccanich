Nesting navigators means rendering a navigator inside a screen of another navigator, for example:

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const HomeTabs = createBottomTabNavigator({
  screens: {
    Feed: FeedScreen,
    Messages: MessagesScreen,
  },
});

const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: {
      screen: HomeTabs,
      options: {
        headerShown: false,
      },
    },
    Profile: ProfileScreen,
  },
});

```

In the above example, `HomeTabs` contains a tab navigator. It is also used for the `Home` screen in your stack navigator in `RootStack`. So here, a tab navigator is nested inside a stack navigator:

- `RootStack` (Stack navigator)
  - `HomeTabs` (Tab navigator)
    - `Feed` (screen)
    - `Messages` (screen)
  - `Profile` (screen)

Nesting navigators work very much like nesting regular components. To achieve the behavior you want, it's often necessary to nest multiple navigators.

## How nesting navigators affects the behaviour [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#how-nesting-navigators-affects-the-behaviour "Direct link to How nesting navigators affects the behaviour")

When nesting navigators, there are some things to keep in mind:

### Each navigator keeps its own navigation history [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#each-navigator-keeps-its-own-navigation-history "Direct link to Each navigator keeps its own navigation history")

For example, when you press the back button when inside a screen in a nested stack navigator, it'll go back to the previous screen inside the nested stack even if there's another navigator as the parent.

### Each navigator has its own options [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#each-navigator-has-its-own-options "Direct link to Each navigator has its own options")

For example, specifying a `title` option in a screen nested in a child navigator won't affect the title shown in a parent navigator.

If you want to achieve this behavior, see the guide for [screen options with nested navigators](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/screen-options-resolution#setting-parent-screen-options-based-on-child-navigators-state). this could be useful if you are rendering a tab navigator inside a stack navigator and want to show the title of the active screen inside the tab navigator in the header of the stack navigator.

### Each screen in a navigator has its own params [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#each-screen-in-a-navigator-has-its-own-params "Direct link to Each screen in a navigator has its own params")

For example, any `params` passed to a screen in a nested navigator are in the `route` object of that screen and aren't accessible from a screen in a parent or child navigator.

If you need to access params of the parent screen from a child screen, you can use [React Context](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) to expose params to children.

### Navigation actions are handled by current navigator and bubble up if couldn't be handled [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#navigation-actions-are-handled-by-current-navigator-and-bubble-up-if-couldnt-be-handled "Direct link to Navigation actions are handled by current navigator and bubble up if couldn't be handled")

For example, if you're calling `navigation.goBack()` in a nested screen, it'll only go back in the parent navigator if you're already on the first screen of the navigator. Other actions such as `navigate` work similarly, i.e. navigation will happen in the nested navigator and if the nested navigator couldn't handle it, then the parent navigator will try to handle it. In the above example, when calling `navigate('Messages')`, inside `Feed` screen, the nested tab navigator will handle it, but if you call `navigate('Settings')`, the parent stack navigator will handle it.

### Navigator specific methods are available in the navigators nested inside [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#navigator-specific-methods-are-available-in-the-navigators-nested-inside "Direct link to Navigator specific methods are available in the navigators nested inside")

For example, if you have a stack inside a drawer navigator, the drawer's `openDrawer`, `closeDrawer`, `toggleDrawer` methods etc. will also be available on the `navigation` object in the screens inside the stack navigator. But say you have a stack navigator as the parent of the drawer, then the screens inside the stack navigator won't have access to these methods, because they aren't nested inside the drawer.

Similarly, if you have a tab navigator inside stack navigator, the screens in the tab navigator will get the `push` and `replace` methods for stack in their `navigation` object.

If you need to dispatch actions to the nested child navigators from a parent, you can use [`navigation.dispatch`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-object#dispatch):

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
navigation.dispatch(DrawerActions.toggleDrawer());

```

### Nested navigators don't receive parent's events [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#nested-navigators-dont-receive-parents-events "Direct link to Nested navigators don't receive parent's events")

For example, if you have a stack navigator nested inside a tab navigator, the screens in the stack navigator won't receive the events emitted by the parent tab navigator such as ( `tabPress`) when using `navigation.addListener`.

To receive events from the parent navigator, you can explicitly listen to parent's events with [`navigation.getParent`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-object#getparent):

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const unsubscribe = navigation
  .getParent('MyTabs')
  .addListener('tabPress', (e) => {
    // Do something
    alert('Tab pressed!');
  });

```

Here `'MyTabs'` refers to the value you pass in the `id` of the parent tab navigator whose event you want to listen to.

### Parent navigator's UI is rendered on top of child navigator [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#parent-navigators-ui-is-rendered-on-top-of-child-navigator "Direct link to Parent navigator's UI is rendered on top of child navigator")

For example, when you nest a stack navigator inside a drawer navigator, you'll see that the drawer appears above the stack navigator's header. However, if you nest the drawer navigator inside a stack, the drawer will appear below the header of the stack. This is an important point to consider when deciding how to nest your navigators.

In your app, you will probably use these patterns depending on the behavior you want:

- Tab navigator nested inside the initial screen of stack navigator - New screens cover the tab bar when you push them.
- Drawer navigator nested inside the initial screen of stack navigator with the initial screen's stack header hidden - The drawer can only be opened from the first screen of the stack.
- Stack navigators nested inside each screen of drawer navigator - The drawer appears over the header from the stack.
- Stack navigators nested inside each screen of tab navigator - The tab bar is always visible. Usually pressing the tab again also pops the stack to top.

## Navigating to a screen in a nested navigator [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#navigating-to-a-screen-in-a-nested-navigator "Direct link to Navigating to a screen in a nested navigator")

Consider the following example:

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const MoreTabs = createBottomTabNavigator({
  screens: {
    Feed: FeedScreen,
    Messages: MessagesScreen,
  },
});

const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: HomeScreen,
    More: {
      screen: MoreTabs,
      options: {
        headerShown: false,
      },
    },
  },
});

```

Here, you might want to navigate to the `More` screen (which contains `MoreTabs`) from your `HomeScreen` component:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
navigation.navigate('More');

```

It works, and the initial screen inside the `MoreTabs` component is shown, which is `Feed`. But sometimes you may want to control the screen that should be shown upon navigation. To achieve it, you can pass the name of the screen in params:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
navigation.navigate('More', { screen: 'Messages' });

```

Now, the `Messages` screen will be rendered instead of `Feed` upon navigation.

### Passing params to a screen in a nested navigator [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#passing-params-to-a-screen-in-a-nested-navigator "Direct link to Passing params to a screen in a nested navigator")

You can also pass params by specifying a `params` key:

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
navigation.navigate('More', {
  screen: 'Messages',
  params: { user: 'jane' },

If the navigator was already rendered, navigating to another screen will push a new screen in case of stack navigator.

You can follow a similar approach for deeply nested screens. Note that the second argument to `navigate` here is just `params`, so you can do something like:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
navigation.navigate('Home', {
  screen: 'Settings',
  params: {
    screen: 'Sound',
    params: {
      screen: 'Media',
    },
  },
});

```

In the above case, you're navigating to the `Media` screen, which is in a navigator nested inside the `Sound` screen, which is in a navigator nested inside the `Settings` screen.

warning

The `screen` and related params are reserved for internal use and are managed by React Navigation. While you can access `route.params.screen` etc. in the parent screens, relying on them may lead to unexpected behavior.

### Rendering initial route defined in the navigator [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#rendering-initial-route-defined-in-the-navigator "Direct link to Rendering initial route defined in the navigator")

By default, when you navigate a screen in the nested navigator, the specified screen is used as the initial screen and the `initialRouteName` prop on the navigator is ignored.

If you need to render the initial route specified in the navigator, you can disable the behaviour of using the specified screen as the initial screen by setting `initial: false`:

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
navigation.navigate('Root', {
  screen: 'Settings',
  initial: false,
});

```

This affects what happens when pressing the back button. When there's an initial screen, the back button will take the user there.

## Avoiding multiple headers when nesting [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#avoiding-multiple-headers-when-nesting "Direct link to Avoiding multiple headers when nesting")

When nesting multiple stack, drawer or bottom tab navigators, headers from both child and parent navigators would be shown. However, usually it's more desirable to show the header in the child navigator and hide the header in the screen of the parent navigator.

To achieve this, you can hide the header in the screen containing the navigator using the `headerShown: false` option.

For example:

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const HomeTabs = createBottomTabNavigator({
  screens: {
    Feed: FeedScreen,
    Messages: MessagesScreen,
  },
});

const RootStack = createNativeStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    Home: {
      screen: HomeTabs,
      options: {
        headerShown: false,
      },
    },
    Profile: ProfileScreen,
  },
});

```

In these examples, we have used a bottom tab navigator directly nested inside another stack navigator, but the same principle applies when there are other navigators in the middle, for example: stack navigator inside a tab navigator which is inside another stack navigator, stack navigator inside drawer navigator etc.

If you don't want headers in any of the navigators, you can specify `headerShown: false` in all of the navigators:

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const HomeTabs = createBottomTabNavigator({
  screenOptions: {
    headerShown: false,
  },
  screens: {
    Feed: FeedScreen,
    Messages: MessagesScreen,
  },
});

const RootStack = createStackNavigator({
  screenOptions: {
    headerShown: false,
  },
  screens: {
    Home: HomeTabs,
    Profile: ProfileScreen,
  },
});

```

## Best practices when nesting [​](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators/\#best-practices-when-nesting "Direct link to Best practices when nesting")

We recommend to reduce nesting navigators to minimal. Try to achieve the behavior you want with as little nesting as possible. Nesting has many downsides:

- It results in deeply nested view hierarchy which can cause memory and performance issues in lower end devices
- Nesting same type of navigators (e.g. tabs inside tabs, drawer inside drawer etc.) might lead to a confusing UX
- With excessive nesting, code becomes difficult to follow when navigating to nested screens, configuring deep link etc.

Think of nesting navigators as a way to achieve the UI you want rather than a way to organize your code. If you want to create separate group of screens for organization, instead of using separate navigators, you can use the [`Group`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/group) component for dynamic configuration or [`groups` property](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/static-configuration#groups) for static configuration.

- Static
- Dynamic

```codeBlockLines_e6Vv
const MyStack = createStackNavigator({
  screens: {
    // Common screens
  },
  groups: {
    // Common modal screens
    Modal: {
      screenOptions: {
        presentation: 'modal',
      },
      screens: {
        Help,
        Invite,
      },
    },
    // Screens for logged in users
    User: {
      if: useIsLoggedIn,
      screens: {
        Home,
        Profile,
      },
    },
    // Auth screens
    Guest: {
      if: useIsGuest,
      screens: {
        SignIn,
        SignUp,
      },
    },
  },
});
